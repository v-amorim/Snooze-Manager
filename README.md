### Snooze-Manager

Snooze-Manager is a modular plugin manager for Pengu Loader. Each QoL feature is implemented as a separate module, and the manager loads them together while keeping configuration consolidated.

Everything is built to be lightweight and event driven: no embedded React application, no bloat, no constant polling of the client for changes and so on.

*Some features are inspired by earlier work, but the implementation here is independent and expanded to offer more than a straight copy.*

### Modes: Manager vs Standalone

- Manager mode: install the whole `Snooze-Manager` plugin. Use the manager hotkey to open the unified settings UI and manage all modules in one place.
- Standalone mode: if you only want one module without the manager, copy `generalUtils.js` plus the desired module file from `modules` into `\Pengu Loader\plugins`. In that case, the module will use the League of Legends native settings menu instead of the manager hotkey interface.
